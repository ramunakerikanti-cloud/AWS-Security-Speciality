# AWS Security IAM Notes

IAM is global service
Administer/User can login to AWS console using root credetails or IAM user credentails
IAM service which is global running on us-east-1 region(N.Virginia)
While user login to aws console, must provide aws accout/alias name
AWS provide two types of access to aws resources 1. AWS Console 2. Programatic Access( using Access and Secret Keys)
You can list, manage your permission what administrator has provided to you. GO to AWS Console-->My Security Credentails
Your AWS root account—the account that’s created when you initially sign up with AWS—has unrestricted access to all your AWS resources
AWS always recommends that you do not generate access keys for your root account.
grant each user permissions based on the principle of least privilege: Grant them only the permissions required to perform their assigned tasks.
To more easily manage the permissions of multiple IAM users, you should assign users with the same permissions to an IAM group.
Your root account should always be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), AWS supports virtual and hardware MFA devices and U2F security keys.
To allow users access to the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you have two options
  - Indentities
  - Federation
AWS has the current limit of 5,000 IAM users in Single Account.
Applications running outside of an AWS environment will need access keys for programmatic access to AWS resources.
An IAM role is a defined set of permissions—it’s not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, any trusted entity can assume the role to perform a specific business task
resources that need programmatic access are running inside AWS, the best practice is to use IAM roles
AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary credentials for use in your code, CLI, or third-party tools.
